This package is available on NPM at [@kewbish/revshare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@kewbish/revshare).

- Run `npm i @kewbish/revshare` to install it in your project.
- It can then be referenced as below:

## Basic Usage

Add a `<rev-share>` tag anywhere in your body.  
This tag requires a `pointers` attribute, formatted in JSON.

```
...
<rev-share pointers='{"$john.wallet": 50, "$alicia.wallet": 50}'>
    <p>This is your revenue-shared content!</p>
</rev-share>
...
```

Additional documentation can be found [in the `docs` folder](./docs/README.md).

> :warning: This rev-share specification is done probablistically nature due to limitations of the Web Monetization protocol.

## About

This project is based on the [proposed Web Monetization protocol](https://webmonetization.org/). It's a browser API which allows the creation of a payment stream from the user agent to the website. Currently, this isn't implemented in any major browsers, but is available through an extension or a custom browser. [Check out Coil.com for more.](https://coil.com).

This project was created for, and won, the [#gftwhackathon](https://dev.to/t/gftwhackathon).
