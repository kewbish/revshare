- Run `npm i @kewbish/revshare` to install it in your project.  
- It can then be referenced as below:

## Basic Usage
Add a `<rev-share>` tag anywhere in your body.  
This tag requires a `pointers` attribute, formatted in JSON.  
```
...
<rev-share pointers='{"$john.wallet": 50, "$alicia.wallet": 50}'>
    <p>This is your revenue-shared content!</p>
</rev-share>
...
```

> :warning: This rev-share specification is not 100% accurate, due to the probablistic nature and the limitations of the Web Monetization format.  

## Project Information
This project is based on the [proposed Web Monetization interface](https://webmonetization.org/). It's a 'browser API which allows the creation of a payment stream from the user agent to the website'. Currently, this isn't implemented in any major browsers, but is available through an extension or a custom browser. [Check out Coil.com for more.](https://coil.com).  
This project was created for the [#gftwhackathon](https://dev.to/t/gftwhackathon).  
A simple landing page is available [on the Pages](https://kewbish.github.io/revshare).  

## Contributions
Issues and feature requests are welcome - but be gentle, I'm new to JS.
